A small game made for the MicroBit made via make code.
Simply put, press the A button to roll the slots and Gamble your (fictional) money away for the potential of getting the juck port.
Can be played on a micro bit but can also be played on the Microsoft makecode website, also can't upload the file in releases so you can just download the code to get the game file.
